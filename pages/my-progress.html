                    Welcome to the porfolio section of my website. Here, I will showcase some 
                    of the projects I have worked on as I continue to develop my skills in web development. 
                    Each project represents a step in my learning journey, and I am excited to share them with you.

                    <strong>Wildfire App</strong><br>
                    This was the first project I ever worked on, with a group of others. It was during my first bootcamp,
                    with U.C. Davis. The app was designed to provide real-time information about wildfires, including their 
                    locations, sizes, and containment status. I contributed to the front-end development using HTML, CSS, 
                    and JavaScript. This project helped me understand the importance of commitng
                    and contributing to a group project with restrictions and constraints for the project. 
                    Like utilizing a weather API for real-time data. And JavaScript libraries to store information. 
                    The users would have a checklist that was provided by CalFire at the time, and would be able 
                    to send alerts to users in the area of an active wildfire.

                    <strong>Archery Survey</strong><br>
                    This project was the first HTML and CSS project I worked on for the Codefy Bootcamp. 
                    This was to coincide with the certification from freecodecamp.org, and to demonstrate our ability
                    to create functional forms. I have a passion for precision sports and archery is one of them. I practice
                    semi-regularly and figured this would be a fun idea, to create a survey for archers to fill out at a range.
                    This was one of several projects for the Codefy Bootcamp, and we did it on codepen.io.

                    <strong>Landing Page Project</strong><br>
                    This was a landing page I created as part of a project to practice HTML and CSS skills. 
                    The page features a clean and modern design, with a focus on user experience and accessibility. 
                    I utilized various HTML elements and CSS properties to create a visually appealing layout that 
                    is responsive across different devices. This was another codefy project. To work with flex box
                    and grid system for create product landing page with mutiple items, real or made up. It was also done
                    on codepen.io

                    <strong>Step By Step Guide</strong><br>
                    This page was to demonstrate my ability to use nav elements in HTML5. It was part of the Codefy bootcamp.
                    Bootcamp curriculum. It needed a nav menu on the left side. Detailed sections with coherent steps to follow.
                    And utilizing an embeded youtube video. It was difficult getting the nav menu to work properly, and to get the
                    embded links going. But I have come a long way since then.

                    <strong>Tribute Page</strong><br>
                    This was the final front end project for the Codefy bootcamp. We needed to create a tribute page to anything we
                    had an interest in. Prior to switch careers, I was studying Natural Resource management with the goal in mind to
                    work in the forestry field, and protecting and mainting healthy forests. And during my studies, I wrote a research
                    paper on the Alaskan Yellow Cedar, an America Cypress. Which since the time of writing the paper, has been reclassified
                    from a true cypresses (Cupressus) to a false cypresses (Chamaecyparis). So I figured this would be a good topic for my tribute page.
                    This encompassed all the previous skills learned from the freedcodecamp.org curriculum, and the Codefy bootcamp into one project.

                    <strong>Busted Top Candles (WIP)</strong><br>
                    This is my first realworld client project. Outside of work and bootcamps. I created a website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. To build the framework.
                    Then I utilized serverless functions with Netlify to create a form that would send emails to the owner when a customer filled out the contact form.
                    This was a good project to flex my skills and knowledge I have gained so far. And I look forward to working on more client projects in the future.
                    It has gone through many iterations and changes since the starting, but it is on a solid foundation. This is the first website I built with a custom 
                    domain name as well. I have an interest in nature photography and wanted to showcase my ability for still life, as
                    all the images are my own photography of the clients candles.
